    "gdp_growth" : '''There seems to be some correlation between GDP growth and house price changes, 
    particularly during major economic events (2008-2009 crisis, 2020 pandemic).\n
    Note: the GDP growth data is taken yearly while others are monthly and growth data is only available till 2023''',
    "population_growth" : '''There doesn't seem to be much correlation between the populatoin growth and house prices 
    at least in short term \n
    Note: population growth data is only available till 2023 and has yearly frequency''',
    'inflation':'''There seems to be a correlation between inflation and house prices especially in recent years. \n
    During the housing crash of 2008 the inflation and house prices both went down but the inflation rate recovered much 
    quicker than the house prices probably due the stimulus by the government''',
    'material_cost':'''Over long term material cost is mostly stable with gradual increase but in recent years especially during 
    the pandemic there is a huge spike which seems to correlate with the increase in house prices''',
    'house_inventory': '''There seems to be some seasonal variation as the inventory dips around the start of the year 
    but overall we can see there is a huge dip during the pandemic which coincides with the increase in prices and even since then
    the inventory hasn't reached the pre covid levels\n
    Note: the data for house inventory is only available from June, 2016''',
    'rent_price' : '''The rent prices have seen a steady growth and the effect of the financial crash was much tamer\n
    but starting the pandemic there is a huge increase in rent prices making housing a more productive asset''',
    'vacancy_rate' : '''There has been a steady decline in vacany rate from the financial crash hinting a possible mismatch 
    between the supply and demand which seems to have reach some sort of peak during the pandemic but such lower vacancy rates
    suggest that landlords can raise rent without fearing the loss of tenants as there are not many places that are vacant''',
    'mortgage_rate' : '''Mortgage rates seem to be inversely proportional to the house prices atleast before the
     pandemic where there is a slowdown increase but not complete slow.\n
     This may be due to the fact as a person has some sort of budget which cannot be exceeded and as most of them don't pay
     in full the mortgage also adds to the full price hence when the rates increases the price of house seen to decrease 
     or at least has a gradual increase as demand outpaces supply but the lower interest rates during pandemic lead to 
     lower mortgage rates and hence the price of house also increased''',
    'Total': '''This is the graph of the total houses build in US as you can see there is some seasonal variation in the 
    no of houses built per year\n
    But the more interesting thing is that the no of houses built reached a peak before the financial crash and dropped 
    precipitously since then and to date hasn't recovered creating a supply shortage \n,
    Note: The data is only available till end of 2023

    'unemployment': '''There seems to be some  inverse correlation between the unemployment and house prices
    some factors such as high enough demand or low enough supply can overturn that \n
    Note: The unemployment data is only available from June, 2004''',
    'shares': '''Stock market and housing prices goes hand in hand for most part both being affected by the financial crash 
    and the pandemic looks like they both are affected by how good the economy is doing and with the recent increase in institutional
    investment in housing market this correlation will probably increase.''',
